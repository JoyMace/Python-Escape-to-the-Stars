# Python-Escape-to-the-Stars
Text based game built in Python 

To play the game you must have all files in one folder on your machine.

Run the game.py file. This is a text based game. 

Known bugs: Borders are secured on the map by a game ending death monster. 
You are allowed to keep walking past a wall and then you die.

In order to experience the full intent of the game you must read the instructions and 
turn around 180 degrees if you're alerted to the presence of a wall.

This game was ported to C++ but does not work as intended in C++ as of yet. 
It is a work in progress.

Thanks for looking!
